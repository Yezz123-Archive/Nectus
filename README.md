# Nectus ðŸš€

Flask Boilerplate to quickly get started with production grade flask application with some additional packages and configuration prebuilt.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9.2 or higher
- PostgreSQL
- Docker

### Backend Setup

```sh
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/yezz123/Nectus.git

# move to the project folder
$ cd Nectus/Backend
```

#### Creating virtual environment

- Install `pipenv` a global python project `pip install pipenv`
- Create a `virtual environment` for this project

```shell
# creating pipenv environment for python 3
$ pipenv --three

# activating the pipenv environment
$ pipenv shell

# if you have multiple python 3 versions installed then
$ pipenv install -d --python 3.8

# install all dependencies (include -d for installing dev dependencies)
$ pipenv install -d
```

#### Configuration

- Create a `.env` file from `.env.sample` and set appropriate environment variables before running the project

```sh
APP_NAME=Nectus

DB_HOST= # Host ex. localhost
DB_DATABASE= # Database
DB_USERNAME= # Username ex. Root
DB_PASSWORD= # Password

JWT_SECRET= # generate a JWT Secret
UPLOAD_FOLDER = public

FLASK_APP=main.py
FLASK_ENV=development
```

#### Database Migration

- Make sure the database name username, password and host have been set in the env

- Migrate and upgrade database into your database management (for this case postgreeSQL)

```sh
flask db init

flask db migrate -m "create new table"

flask db upgrade
```

#### Running app

- If you feel that everything can be run, then run the Flash API

```sh
flask run
```

### Frontend Setup

- We Just finish the Configuration for the backend part, now let's try to run the Frontend Side.
- Our Frontend Based on ReactJs & with some simple addons.

```sh
#change Directory to Frontend
$ cd ../ && cd Frontend

# Prepare the environment by Installing all the Packages
$ npm install package.json
```

- If all the Packages are installed and you see `node_modules` Folder Start :
- if you feel there is no error in the settings of `.env`.
- make sure the API url is correct.
- If you feel that everything can be run, then run Frontend Part.

```sh
# Build the Project
$ npm run build

# Start The Project
$ npm run start
```

- default port <http://localhost:5000/>

```env
REACT_APP_URL_API = http://localhost:5000
```

`yapf` packages for `linting and formatting`

## Running the Docker Container

- We have the Dockerfile created in above section. Now, we will use the Dockerfile to create the image of the flask app and then start the flask app container.

```sh
docker build
```

- list all the docker images and you can also see the image `nectus:latest` in the list.

```sh
docker images
```

- run the application at port 5000. The various options used are:

> - `-p`: publish the container's port to the host port.
> - `-d`: run the container in the background.
> - `-i`: run the container in interactive mode.
> - `-t`: to allocate pseudo-TTY.
> - `--name`: name of the container

```sh
docker container run -p 5000:5000 -dit --name Nectus nectus:latest
```

- Check the status of the docker container

```sh
docker container ps
```
